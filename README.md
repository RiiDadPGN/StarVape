## Usage
1. Download the specific scripting utility/executor of your choice. Make sure it's supported.
2. Execute the provided loadstring below.
```luau
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RiiDadPGN/StarVape/main/NewMainScript.lua", true))()
```

## Possible Issues
Half of the time its usually the executor causing faults, please make sure the executor meets certain quality standards such as:
1. Supporting file functions & the debug library.
2. Not implementing lua generated / half baked versions of such functions resulting in unintended behavior.
3. Maintaing the same behavior across all usages of said functions.
### User Issues
If it's not the executor at fault, please try some troubleshooting steps.
1. Deleting the newvape folder (WITH THE GAME CLOSED).
2. Making sure you have connection to [the main loadstring.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RiiDadPGN/StarVape/refs/heads/main/NewMainScript.lua)
3. Ensuring no external script is conflicting with star vape.
